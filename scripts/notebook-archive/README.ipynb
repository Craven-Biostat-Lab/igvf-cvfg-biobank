    "1. **`Per-gene VAT import`**: This takes the [AoU Variant Annotation Table (VAT)](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/4615256690836-Variant-Annotation-Table) and splits it up into per-gene files for our genes of interest and filters them to missense only. This should only be re-run if we are adding genes or if the VAT is updated. Review exclusion filter in the notebook before running again. Can be run in the background using `Run Per-gene VAT import in the Background`.\n",
    "1. **`Missense counts for genes of interest`**: Loads case cohort data and saves it to gzipped `tsv` files for downstream analysis, and counts missense variants in the case cohorts. Should only be re-run if cohort definitions change.\n",
    "1. **`Prepare control pools for loading`**: Loads control cohort data and saves it to gzipped `tsv` files for downstream analysis.\n",
    "1. **`OR for MAVEs`**: Cmoputes ORs using Logistic Regression and saves results in gzipped json files. Can be run in the background using `Run MAVE OR in Background`. \n",
    "1. **`OR for MAVEs plot`**: Generates plots from the output of `OR for MAVEs`."
